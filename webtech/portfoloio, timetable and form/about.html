    <img src="profile.jpg" alt="Aryan Srivastava" width="150" height="150">
    <p>Hello! I'm Aryan Srivastava, currently pursuing an MCA with a strong focus on app development. I have a passion for creating user-centric digital experiences that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing. My journey in the tech world began with
        a fascination for how things work, and it has led me to develop a broad skill set that includes software development, UI/UX design, and project management.</p>
    <p>In my current studies and projects, I strive to combine my technical knowledge with creative problem-solving to build innovative solutions. I am also actively involved in extracurricular activities, including my recent application for a leadership
        role in the IEEE Computer Society. I believe in continuous learning and am always eager to take on new challenges that push the boundaries of what's possible in the world of technology.</p>
    <p>When I'm not coding or working on a new project, I enjoy exploring the latest trends in technology, participating in hackathons, and collaborating with like-minded individuals to bring ideas to life. I am excited about the future and the endless possibilities
        that lie ahead in the ever-evolving tech landscape.</p>
